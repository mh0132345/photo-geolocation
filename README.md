# NativeScript Photos Near Me

This is a demo application for Android and iOS developed with NativeScript, Angular 2, and TypeScript.  It was designed to demonstrate device geolocation, usage of maps, and consuming remote API data from the Flickr API.

### iOS 9+ and Android 6+ Notes

To use geolocation in the later versions of Android and iOS, permission is required on the host device.  Upon running the application, a request for permission will be triggered.  If denied, the only way to provide permission is to either re-install the application or go to the device settings.
